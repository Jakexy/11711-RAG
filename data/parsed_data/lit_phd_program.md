Ph.D. in Language and Information Technology

Ph.D. students are expected to publish papers about original research in the most competitive scientific journals and international conference proceedings, and to present their research at conferences and workshops. Most of our Ph.D. graduates become professors and research scientists, while a few have started their own companies.


Overview

The Ph.D. in LTI focuses on developing the next generation of scientific and entrepreneurial leaders. The first two years of the Ph.D. program are similar to our MLT program. After the second year, you will spend most of your time working closely with your faculty advisor on research that advances the state-of-the-art in computer science.

Requirements

In general, students pursuing a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies must

Pass at least 96 units of graduate-level courses.
Satisfy proficiencies in writing, presentation, programming and teaching; and
Propose, write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis).

Course Categories

Ph.D. and MLT Course Categories
The Ph.D. and MLT programs organize courses into several different categories. This page explains the courses in each category and provides category-related information.

The course lists below include courses from outside of the LTI that count as LTI courses (as opposed to electives) for satisfying degree requirements. Further information about these courses is available on the web pages of the departments that offer them.

Depending on a student's interests, electives may be taken from the LTI, other departments in the School of Computer Science, or other departments at Carnegie Mellon or the University of Pittsburgh. Students interested in speech should consider speech-oriented electives; other areas of interest include linguistics, statistics, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

Undergraduate course: Undergraduate courses have numbers below xx-600. Senior-level undergraduate courses (xx-4xx and xx-5xx) count for MLT graduation credit, but not PhD graduation credit.

Graduate course: Graduate courses have numbers of xx-600 and above.

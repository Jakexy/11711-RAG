["Media Inquiries\n\nSweepstakes, also known as the Buggy Races, has come a long way at Carnegie Mellon University. The slick, torpedo-like vessels carrying drivers with nerves of steel are a far cry from the two-man teams that once changed places halfway through a race and rode in everything from rain barrels with bicycle wheels to three-wheeled ash cans 99 years ago.\n\nToday, it takes six people to maneuver the .84 -mile course around Schenley Park's Flagstaff Hill.\n\nBut while five pushers and a driver navigate the course's hills, dozens of people are needed to make a successful race happen. A year of planning goes into just over two minutes of racing.\n\n\nThe Machine\n\nThe basics of a buggy are straightforward, but teams are often secretive in how they build the machines, in particular the way they brake, steer and what types of wheels are used.\n\nEach has a body, pushbar for runners to move the machine up the hills, wheels, a safety harness and driving and braking mechanisms.

Other teams, such as Apex, often use names that connotate fire, while the SDC (Student Dormitory Committee) team, uses names such as Vice, Bane, Avarice and Malice.\n\nThis year's buggy names will be under wraps until Thursday, when the Buggy Showcase will take place from noon to 2 p.m. in Weigand Gymnasium in the Cohon University Center.

It's one of the few times spectators can see buggies up close.\n\n\nBehind the Wheel\n\nDrivers, have the closest connection to the vehicles, aside from the mechanics who spent countless hours building and maintaining individual buggies. While races are brief, each driver must log a number of practice runs to qualify to race. Teams practice nights and weekends throughout the fall and spring semesters as weather permits. Buggies are often built around drivers, so the fit can be snug, and drivers are often less than 5 feet, 3 inches in height.

I wanted to drive so badly.\"\n\nSafety is a top priority for teams. All drivers are required to have five pieces of safety gear: mouth guard, goggles, a harness that includes three points of contact to the body of the buggy, gloves and a helmet. And during practice runs and races, flaggers man the course to let drivers know if it's safe to proceed.\n\nThe streets of the race course haven't changed, but the condition of the course varies due to potholes, which can make or break a fast run.

Here are 25 great ideas from CMU computer scientists to think about as we celebrate the birthday of the School of Computer Science.\n\n\n1.

Title: Accurate detection of reactive oxygen species by tuning an elastic motif (GPGGA)4 in nanopores.
Abstract: We have developed a reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensor based on nanopores modified with GGGCEG(GPGGA)4CEG. The formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond oxidized by ROS leads to conformation changes in GGGCEG(GPGGA)4CEG, which then induces an obvious change in the size of the nanopores and a corresponding ionic current change. This work allows the accurate and dynamic monitoring of ROS through the combination of (GPGGA)4 and nanopores.

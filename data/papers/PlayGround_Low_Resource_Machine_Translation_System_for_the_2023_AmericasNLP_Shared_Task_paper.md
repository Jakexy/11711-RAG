Title: PlayGround Low Resource Machine Translation System for the 2023 AmericasNLP Shared Task
Abstract: This paper presents PlayGroundâ€™s submission to the AmericasNLP 2023 shared task on machine translation (MT) into indigenous languages. We finetuned NLLB-600M, a multilingual MT model pre-trained on Flores-200, on 10 low-resource language directions and examined the effectiveness of weight averaging and back translation. Our experiments showed that weight averaging, on average, led to a 0.0169 improvement in the ChrF++ score. Additionally, we found that back translation resulted in a 0.008 improvement in the ChrF++ score.
